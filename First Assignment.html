    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol type="1" class="list">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen ,paper,or in other media. </li>
        <br>
        <li> <b><del> Css is not neccesary</del>></b> <mark> <b> CSS saves a lot of work. </b> </mark>it can control the layout of muiltiple web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li class="font"><u>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML Documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul type="disc" class="first">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section </li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<mark> in this 
            tutorial we will use inline and Internal styles,</mark> becouse this is easier to demonsterate, and easier 
            for you to try it yourself. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS claas vs ID, the difference is that CSS class appies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand ,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also
        spesial in that you can use a URL to link directly to link to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or rsnge of elements on a web page. Once an element has been target, a style or set of style can be applied to the 
        element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
